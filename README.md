# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O #

# General #
  - At least four different sorting algorithms
  - What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
  - How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
  - What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Tasks ##

1. [x] Task-0: **Bubble sort**
   - Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.
     - big O notation: **O(n^2)**
     - Files: ***0-bubble_sort.c***, ***0-O***

2. [x] Task-1: **Insertion sort**
    - Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm.
      - big O notation:
        - in the best case: O(n)
        - in the average case: O(n^2)
        - in the worst case: O(n^2)
      - files: ***1-insertion_sort_list.c***, ***1-O***
